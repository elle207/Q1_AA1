        <p> Corruption in our country, the Philippines, continues to be a grave barrier to national progress, with local and national leaders often misusing public resources for personal benefit. Billions of pesos paid by taxpayers that should be allocated for the betterment of the Filipinos are going into the wallets of corrupt politicians. 
            Because of this, poverty has worsened, the gap between rich and poor has grown wider, and trust in leaders is fading.
            Politics in our country is often treated as a family inheritance. Many officials pass down their positions to children, spouses, or relatives, ensuring that their control over power and resources continues across generations or within their circle. 
            This cycle of political dynasties doesn't just block true democracy-it also shuts down new, capable, and honest leaders. Exposing these practices is crucial to opening the eyes of the Filipinos to the deep-rooted corruption that robs national progress we all yearn for.
